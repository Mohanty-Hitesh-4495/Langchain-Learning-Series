## 📘Introduction to LangChain and LangGraph: 

**LangChain** is an open-source framework designed to help developers build **applications powered by Large Language Models (LLMs)**, such as those from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.

It makes it easy to integrate LLMs with:
- External data (files, websites, databases)
- Custom tools (search, APIs)
- Chains of logic (multi-step reasoning)

### Why LangChain?

LLMs are powerful, but raw prompts are limited. LangChain helps you:
- **Compose prompts & LLMs into logical steps (chains)**
- **Access private or real-time data using tools like vector DBs or APIs**
- **Track & debug LLM calls using LangSmith**
- **Build production-grade apps with memory, agents, tracing, and more**

 
### Key Features

- Chains Combine prompt → LLM → output in workflows
- Chat Models Handle conversation using message-based prompts
- RAG Retrieve context from external sources
- Agents Let LLMs use tools and make decisions
- Memory Store chat history or session context
- LangSmith Debug, test, and monitor your LangChain app
- Embeddings Convert text into vectors for search
- Vector Stores Store and query embedded data (Chroma, FAISS, etc.)

### Real-World Use Cases

- Chatbots with custom knowledge
- Document Q&A systems
- Resume analyzers
- Coding assistants
- AI search engines

### What is LangGraph?

**LangGraph** is a powerful extension of LangChain that helps you build **stateful, multi-step, branching workflows** using **LLMs as agents** - like a **graph of language model steps**.

It combines the flexibility of **state machines** with the intelligence of **LLMs**.

### What Problem Does LangGraph Solve?

While LangChain's basic chains are **linear** (Step 1 → Step 2 → ...), real-world tasks often need:

-   **Loops**
-   **Conditionals (if/else)**
-   **Multiple agents/tools**    
-   **Dynamic execution paths**
    
That’s where **LangGraph** shines - it allows you to build **custom graphs with logic**, powered by LLMs.

### Core Concepts 

- **Node**: A function or LLM step in the graph (e.g., summarizer, verifier, decider)
- **Edges**: Define transitions between nodes (can be fixed or LLM-controlled)
- **State**: Shared memory between nodes; updated at each step
- **Graph**: Full flow of logic with LLMs deciding the next steps
- **Router**: A node that decides the next step based on state or LLM output

### Use Cases

-   Autonomous research agents
-   Chatbots with memory and decision trees
-   Workflow-driven LLM applications (e.g., write → review → improve)
-   Agentic tools that switch between tools/models/steps

### Example

> “Create a system that summarizes a document → sends it for review → asks LLM if revision is needed → loops if needed → stops when approved.”

LangGraph allows this complex logic **seamlessly**.

### 📁 Summary

> **LangGraph = LangChain + Graph Workflow Control**
> Use it when your LLM app needs **multi-step logic, memory, tool routing, or loops**
